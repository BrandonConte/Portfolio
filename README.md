Brandon Conte - Unit 2 - Advanced CSS Challenge

In this project contains my Week 2 Challenge - For building a website with Advanced CSS

Challenges included using Flex to properly manage the website for any form of device or screen size to be able to fit and display properly.

I've tried to make this as clean as possible for future editions on building my portfolio further.
